# ðŸŒ¦ Project: Weather API

I created a web application so a user can enter a city + country and return the temperature in Fahrenheit.

## How It's Made:

I'm using 1 API to locate anywhere in the world by the users search term, plotting the location as coordinates, and then querying said coordinates into the OpenWeatherMap API. Then after grabbing your location and weather, I'm displaying a visually correct animation that shows what type of weather is happening in that location.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VisualEarth API (location), and the OpenWeatherMap API.
